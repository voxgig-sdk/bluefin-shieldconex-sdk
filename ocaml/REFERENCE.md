# BluefinShieldconex OCaml SDK Reference

Complete API reference for the BluefinShieldconex OCaml SDK.


## Sdk_client

### Constructor

```ocaml
open Voxgig_struct
open Sdk_helpers

let client = Sdk_client.make options
```

Create a new SDK client instance from a `value` options map. Use
`Sdk_client.make0 ()` for defaults.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `options` | `value` | SDK configuration options (a Map). |
| `apikey` | `string` | API key for authentication. |
| `base` | `string` | Base URL for API requests. |
| `prefix` | `string` | URL prefix appended after base. |
| `suffix` | `string` | URL suffix appended after path. |
| `headers` | `map` | Custom headers for all requests. |
| `feature` | `map` | Feature configuration. |
| `system` | `map` | System overrides (e.g. custom fetch). |


### Static constructors

#### `Sdk_client.test testopts sdkopts`

Create a test client with mock features active. Both arguments may be `Noval`
(`Sdk_client.test ()` uses defaults, `Sdk_client.test_with` takes explicit
options).

```ocaml
let client = Sdk_client.test ()
```


### Instance functions

#### `Sdk_client.detokenize client entopts : entity_obj`

Create a `Detokenize` entity accessor. Pass `Noval` for no initial options.

#### `Sdk_client.tokenize client entopts : entity_obj`

Create a `Tokenize` entity accessor. Pass `Noval` for no initial options.

#### `Sdk_client.tokenize_batch client entopts : entity_obj`

Create a `TokenizeBatch` entity accessor. Pass `Noval` for no initial options.

#### `Sdk_client.tokenize_read client entopts : entity_obj`

Create a `TokenizeRead` entity accessor. Pass `Noval` for no initial options.

#### `Sdk_client.validate client entopts : entity_obj`

Create a `Validate` entity accessor. Pass `Noval` for no initial options.

#### `Sdk_client.direct client fetchargs : value`

Make a direct HTTP request to any API endpoint. Returns a result `value` map
with `ok`, `status`, `headers`, and `data` (or `err` on failure). This
escape hatch never raises — branch on `getp result "ok"`.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | `string` | URL path with optional `{param}` placeholders. |
| `method` | `string` | HTTP method (default: `"GET"`). |
| `params` | `map` | Path parameter values. |
| `query` | `map` | Query string parameters. |
| `headers` | `map` | Request headers (merged with defaults). |
| `body` | `value` | Request body (Maps are JSON-serialized). |

**Returns:** a result `value` map.

#### `Sdk_client.prepare client fetchargs : value`

Prepare a fetch definition without sending. Returns the `fetchdef` and raises
on error.

        ("telemetry", jo [("active", Bool true)]);
        ("test", jo [("active", Bool true)]);
        ("timeout", jo [("active", Bool true)]);
    ]);
])
```


### Configuring features

Each feature is inactive until switched on, and an SDK with no feature
configured does no feature work at all. Every option below keeps its default
unless you name it.

The array form of \`feature\` is significant: several features wrap the
transport, and the order you list them in is the order they nest.

#### Ordering

`ratelimit`, `retry`, `timeout` wrap the transport. Each
wraps whatever is already installed, so **activation order is nesting order**:
a feature activated later sits OUTSIDE one activated earlier, and sees the call
first.

That decides behaviour, not just sequence: a feature that short-circuits the
call, such as a cache serving a hit, stops every feature nested inside it from
ever seeing that call.

`audit`, `clienttrack`, `idempotency`, `log`, `metrics`, `paging`, `telemetry`, `test` attach to pipeline hooks
rather than the transport, so their order does not affect what they observe.

#### `audit`

Structured audit trail of operations.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `actor` | `'anonymous'` |
| `max` | `1000` |

Options above are those the model carries a default for. A feature may
also accept callback options — a `sink` to receive each record, for
instance — which have no default and are covered in the full feature
reference.

**Usage**

Set `feature.audit.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.

**Considerations**

- Attaches to pipeline hooks, not the transport, so activation order does
  not change what it observes.
- Inactive by default: leaving it out costs nothing at runtime.

#### `clienttrack`

Client identity and per-request correlation headers.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `clientVersion` | `'0.0.1'` |

Options above are those the model carries a default for. A feature may
also accept callback options — a `sink` to receive each record, for
instance — which have no default and are covered in the full feature
reference.

**Usage**

Set `feature.clienttrack.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.

**Considerations**

- Attaches to pipeline hooks, not the transport, so activation order does
  not change what it observes.
- Inactive by default: leaving it out costs nothing at runtime.

#### `idempotency`

Idempotency keys for safe retries of mutating operations.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `header` | `'Idempotency-Key'` |
| `methods` | `['POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE']` |
| `ops` | `['create', 'update', 'remove']` |

Options above are those the model carries a default for. A feature may
also accept callback options — a `sink` to receive each record, for
instance — which have no default and are covered in the full feature
reference.

**Usage**

Set `feature.idempotency.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.

**Considerations**

- Attaches to pipeline hooks, not the transport, so activation order does
  not change what it observes.
- Inactive by default: leaving it out costs nothing at runtime.

#### `log`

Structured request and response logging.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `true` |

Options above are those the model carries a default for. A feature may
also accept callback options — a `sink` to receive each record, for
instance — which have no default and are covered in the full feature
reference.

**Usage**

Set `feature.log.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.

**Considerations**

- Attaches to pipeline hooks, not the transport, so activation order does
  not change what it observes.
- Inactive by default: leaving it out costs nothing at runtime.

#### `metrics`

Statistics capture: per-operation counters and latency.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |

Options above are those the model carries a default for. A feature may
also accept callback options — a `sink` to receive each record, for
instance — which have no default and are covered in the full feature
reference.

**Usage**

Set `feature.metrics.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.

**Considerations**

- Attaches to pipeline hooks, not the transport, so activation order does
  not change what it observes.
- Inactive by default: leaving it out costs nothing at runtime.

#### `paging`

Pagination signals for list operations.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `afterVar` | `'after'` |
| `cursorParam` | `'cursor'` |
| `firstVar` | `'first'` |
| `limitParam` | `'limit'` |
| `pageParam` | `'page'` |
| `startPage` | `1` |

also accept callback options — a `sink` to receive each record, for
instance — which have no default and are covered in the full feature
reference.

**Usage**

Set `feature.paging.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.

**Considerations**

- Attaches to pipeline hooks, not the transport, so activation order does
  not change what it observes.
- Inactive by default: leaving it out costs nothing at runtime.

#### `ratelimit`

Client-side rate limiting via a token bucket.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `burst` | `5` |
| `rate` | `5` |

also accept callback options — a `sink` to receive each record, for
instance — which have no default and are covered in the full feature
reference.

**Usage**

Set `feature.ratelimit.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.

**Considerations**

- Wraps the transport: its place in the activation order decides what it
  sees. See [Ordering](#ordering) above.
- Inactive by default: leaving it out costs nothing at runtime.

#### `retry`

Automatic retry of transient failures with exponential backoff.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `factor` | `2` |
| `maxDelay` | `2000` |
| `minDelay` | `50` |

#### `test`

In-memory mock transport for testing without a live server.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |
|---|---|

also accept callback options — a `sink` to receive each record, for
instance — which have no default and are covered in the full feature
reference.

**Usage**

Set `feature.test.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.
